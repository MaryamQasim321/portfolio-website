<h1>About</h1>

<p>
    I am a computer science student with a strong foundation in web development and programming.
     I have gained experience in Java and JavaFX, and I have completed several projects in these 
     areas. In addition to Java, I am skilled in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, databases, and
      have a basic understanding of PHP and WebSocket. My knowledge extends to object-oriented 
      programming and data structures in Java, which 
    has further strengthened my problem-solving abilities and development skills across multiple platforms.
